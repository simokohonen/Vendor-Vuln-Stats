# 'Vendor Vulnerability Statistics' Index 

Work in progress!

Vendors releasing vulnerable software, hardware and applications remains a critical problem for organizations globally.

The 'Vendor Vulnerability Statistics' indexes Aggregate Score is created by aggregating all high-severity CVEs from the past five years, the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) feed, and known vulnerabilities used by ransomware actors (from BushidoToken's Ransomware Matrix.)

The Aggregate Score is a weighted score across the three columns (CVE, CISA and Ransomware Matrix) with the following weighting: CVE=0.2, CISA=0.3, Ransomware=0.5

NOTE! This is an experimental scoring and does not, in it's current form, indicate direct risk of using a product by a given vendor.
